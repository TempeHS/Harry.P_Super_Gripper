## Objective of Prosthethic
The Proshtethic Arm, dubbed "**Super Gripper**"

## Purpose of Intent
I would like to create an arm that is able to allow my patient, **Aaron** to rock climb again without the need for assistance from others. Due to the loss of his right arm, **Aaron** is unable to rock climb or do most daily activities without assistance. Thus, he wants a design that is flexible and multi-purpose. Along with the that, my design should be durable and sturdy, allowing **Aaron** to rock climb more effectively without the worry of the arm breaking. For my final design, I want to create an arm that has multiple joints, being able to control the speed of each motor and is battery powered, being optimally set to allow the arm to function effectively without the sacrifice of battery power. The design also should have a sturdy design and a durable material. My final function that I would like to add is realistic-looking silicone.  

Having the realistic-looking silicone allows the user to not stand out for having a prosthetic, preventing him from having any prejudices. The optimal balance between speed and battery power allows the user to use the arm for long periods of time without sacrificing the time spent for recharging the arm, allowing the user to be more social. The biomedical arm also can help the user rock climb as it is similar to a human arm, making **Aaron**, the patient, more used to it. Without the arm standing out clearly thanks to the silicone, it allows the patient to interact with other rock climbers without standing out, making each interaction less awkward. The arm also lets the user integrate it into his daily life, using it for basic tasks such as carry stuff or pulling open doors.

## Evaluation of Success
I was able to create the arm that I have designed, allowing the arm to close when the Ultrasonic Sensor detect something close to the arm. However, I wasn't able to add the battery to the Arduino, so I had to use the Led Pin and the Buzzer to activate when the Ultrasonic Sensor Detects something instead of activating at a low battery. Still, I had created a product that I am happy with, being as close to my original idea as possible.
